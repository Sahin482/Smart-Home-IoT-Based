# Smart-Home-IoT-Based
Cisco Packet Tracer Version: 8.2.1.0118.

Smart IoT home automation is the ability to control home appliances through electronically controlled, internet-connected systems. This can include presenting complex heating and lighting systems and setting alarms and home security controls. Internet connected IoE computer or device uses IoT technology for remote monitoring and control of various home appliances. Here we have done all the work using a cloud server. I used the recently released Cisco Packet Tracer simulation tool to build and customize an IOE system with classical networking devices for smart home deployment. 

There are several reasons why we have selected this project as follows:
• Control homes easily from different locations using cloud servers through cell towers.
• Being able to keep all the technology in your home connected through one interface is a huge step forward for technology and home management.
• You can’t remotely control all the devices in your home when you’re away, but you can easily control them from wherever you are with a smart home system.
• For returning home from the office or University, you cannot turn on your air cooler at home, but if you use a smart home system, you can turn on/off the air conditioner on the road or from the office.
• Maybe if you are in the office now your room door will be closed when a guest comes to your room, but if you are using the smart home system then you can open the room door sitting in the office and you can monitor it through a cc camera.

Through this project, we will be able to control our IoT devices through different cell towers and here we have completed server-one routing, IoT device setup, etc.
